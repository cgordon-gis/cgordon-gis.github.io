      <h1>GIS downloads</h1>

      </div>
      <p>Please note that these files are provided 'as is'.  My priority is to the students and staff of the School of Earth and Environment in Leeds and I am unable to spend much time in supporting external users.</p>
      <p>If you are downloading .zip or .7z files, right-click and save to your University OneDrive or a local drive if you are on your own computer,
	      then unzip by right-clicking and extract (<a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">preferably with <strong>7-zip</strong></a>) before you use the contents in GIS.
	      Note that 7-zip has proved much more reliable for unzipping files in the past than Extract All in Windows.</p>

      <h2>Workbooks</h2>
      <p>The date of latest update is given on the front cover of each individual workbook.  Some workbooks include a list of the latest updates immediately after the contents list.</p>
      <p>If you are a member of the University of Leeds and wish to have a copy of the data that I provide for the students on my courses to go with the workbook, please email me at <a href="mailto:c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk?Subject=GIS%20Request%20Data%20from%20website">c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk</a> and let me know which workbook you are interested in.</p>
