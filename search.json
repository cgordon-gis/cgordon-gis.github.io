Useful for whole-world or country-wide background mapping.\nIf you’re not sure how to get started with this data try the “Quick start kit” which includes styled data in an ArcMap mxd document and a QGIS project. Download the approximately 160 MB zip file from the Natural Earth downloads page.\n\n\nOpen Street Map\nThe map equivalent of Wikipedia. Can be extremely useful, but be aware of possible inaccuracies! The data can be edited by anyone - it’s the equivalent of Wikipedia for maps. Some areas are very sparsely covered. It tends to depend on whether an OSM enthusiast lives in or has visited an area. Of course, you could always edit it for yourself. The big advantage is that you can use the mapping under an Open Data Commons Open Database licence as long as you credit “© OpenStreetMap contributors”.\nVector data for limited areas can be downloaded from the OSM site and imported into various GIS software including Arc. To download shapefiles for entire countries or regions try Geofabrik. Once you have the data you will need to style it in some way. This is probably most useful if you just want, for example, the rivers for an area for which you can’t find any other data.\n\n\nGADM\nAdministrative boundaries for all countries of the World.\n\n\nFree GIS data\nLong list of free datasets. Plenty of world-wide thematic data, such as population or climate. Also has section on country-specific data. Worth applying the warning at the top of the page to all GIS data!\n\n\nArcGIS Living Atlas of the World\nA searchable and browsable list of a wide range of datasets. Some are background layers, but there are also data layers, such as earthquakes.\nDirectly viewable in ArcGIS Online from links on the pages.\nTo find out how to use living atlas layers in QGIS, view the tutorial by Geography Realm.\n\n\nBackground layers in ArcMap or QGIS\nIn ArcMap you can use layers from ArcGIS online as backgrounds for your maps. Do check these print, though, they don’t always!\nIn QGIS there are some plugins which provide access to web mapping, such as OpenStreetMap. Try QuickMapServices, or the OpenLayers plugin."

This is usually very easy to solve.\nTo reactivate the Processing plugin:\n\nOpen the Plugin Manager by going to Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins in the menu.\nClick on Installed on the left and look for the Processing entry.\nYou’ll probably find there isn’t a tick in the box next to Processing.

Unfortunately, on a Mac, this tool sometimes causes an error and doesn’t run.\n\n\nSolution\nUnfortunately this seems to be a problem with Mac not having an updated QGIS package. There doesn’t seem to be a solution at the moment (March 2023), but we’ll keep an eye on the Github page about the error.\nUntil a solution becomes available, all I can suggest is that you try the selection/intersection/extraction tool without using fix geometries. Sometimes this will work. If you get an error telling you that you need to fix geometries, then I’m afraid the only solution I can suggest for now is to log on to a Windows computer in a cluster to run this part of the processing."

Even if you change columns to a numerical type, such as Real before you import them, they are still text once imported. This means you can’t then use them in the Field Calculator to create a Total column.\n\n\nSolution\nYou can correct this problem by using the Refactor fields tool. Search for Refactor in the Processing toolbox. Once you open that tool you can change field types, so change the fields to Decimal (double) or Integer (if you don’t have decimal places) and you should be able to use the field calculator on them."

The error message says something about a particular file not being specified. If you run the same tool with exactly the same parameters, but save the output to a file, it works with no problem.\nYou can get around this easily when running individual tools, just by saving the output to file, but if building a graphic model it isn’t possible to use the output of one algorithm as the input to another.\n\n\nSolution\nThe solution appears to be to change the default output extension in the QGIS options as this may be set to a format such as xtf.\nIn QGIS, go to Settings &gt; Options. Look for the Processing tab and click on the General subheading at the top of that page. Next to Default output vector layer extension type gpkg.

    "text": "Since November 2021, 30DaysOfMaps has been running on social media. Started by Tuki Tjukanov, this involves map makers, cartographers and anyone else with an interest in maps, creating maps for a series of 30 prompts.\nI didn’t have time in November 2021 or November 2022 to take part, but enjoyed following the hashtag and seeing what other people came up with. Instead I decided to spread my workings over the following years. This portfolio is the result of my efforts, combining the prompts from the two months but also from following the challenge myself during November 2023 and November 2025, when I posted the results to Mastodon.\nThere are still many I haven’t done yet, and I have multiple maps for some of the prompts. It’s great fun and I’m learning a lot, both about techniques and new sources of data that I’ll be able to recommend to my students.

Thought about it this time, but it would have taken too long.\nWould this benefit from a key? As it is, it is decorative, but a key would make it a bit more informative…\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloaded bathymetry and elevation data. Both needed to be merged then reprojected to British National Grid.\nStyled each individually as singleband pseudocolour with appropriate colour ramps.\nDuplicated both layers and styled the copies as hillshade with Multiply blending mode, and quite a bit of transparency so they’re not too obvious!\nSet up a layout for the area I wanted, added title etc, scalebar and extent indicator.\nExported layout as image.\nImported into Inkscape and added labels using spacing between letters, and text on path for the Sound of Raasay label.\nFinally, exported as a png image."
