	 <h2>General and background mapping</h2>

	 <h3><a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a></h3>
	 <p>Extremely useful open source mapping of the whole world at general scales.  Useful for whole-world or country-wide background mapping.</p>
	 <p>If you're not sure how to get started with this data try the "Quick start kit" which includes styled data in an ArcMap mxd document and a QGIS project.  Download the approximately 160 MB zip file from the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth downloads page</a>.</p>

	 <h3><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a></h3>
	 <p>The map equivalent of Wikipedia.  Can be extremely useful, but be aware of possible inaccuracies!  The data can be edited by anyone - it's the equivalent of Wikipedia for maps.  Some areas are very sparsely covered.  It tends to depend on whether an OSM enthusiast lives in or has visited an area.  Of course, you could always edit it for yourself. The big advantage is that you can use the mapping under an Open Data Commons Open Database licence as long as you credit "&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors".</p>
	 <p>Vector data for limited areas can be downloaded from the OSM site and imported into various GIS software including Arc.  To download shapefiles for entire countries or regions try <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html">Geofabrik</a>.  Once you have the data you will need to style it in some way. This is probably most useful if you just want, for example, the rivers for an area for which you can't find any other data.</p>

	 <h3><a href="https://gadm.org/">GADM</a> </h3>
	 <p>Administrative boundaries for all countries of the World.</p>

	 <h3><a href="http://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/">Free GIS data</a> </h3>
	 <p>Long list of free datasets.  Plenty of world-wide thematic data, such as population or climate.  Also has section on country-specific data. Worth applying the warning at the top of the page to all GIS data!</p>

	<h3><a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World</a></h3>
	      <p>A searchable and browsable list of a wide range of datasets.  Some are background layers, but there
		      are also data layers, such as earthquakes.</p>
		      <p>Directly viewable in ArcGIS Online from links on the pages. </p>
		      <p>To find out how to use living atlas layers in QGIS, view the 
		      <a href="https://www.geographyrealm.com/how-to-add-data-from-arcgis-online-to-qgis/">tutorial by Geography Realm</a>.</p>

	 <h3>Background layers in ArcMap or QGIS</h3>
	 <p>In ArcMap you can use layers from ArcGIS online as backgrounds for your maps.  Do check these print, though, they don't always!</p>
	 <p>In QGIS there are some plugins which provide access to web mapping, such as OpenStreetMap.  Try QuickMapServices, or the OpenLayers plugin.</p>
