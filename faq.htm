	<h1>GIS frequently asked questions</h1>
	<p>Answers to questions that I'm asked frequently, but that aren't in one of the <a href="downloads.htm">regular workbooks</a>.</p>  
	<p>Email me using the address at the bottom of the page if you have any other questions - but please check the workbook for the answer before you do so! Remember that the workbook also lists other sources of help, including YouTube videos, and that a search of the web can often give you useful information.</p>

	    <h3>I'm getting an error when I try to assign a projection, or reproject a layer in QGIS.  I'm using a Mac.</h3>

	    <h4>Problem</h4>
	    <p class="problem">When you try to run the Assign Projection or Warp tools in QGIS, you get an error which says "ERROR 1: PROJ: proj_create_from_database: Cannot find proj.db".  The tool doesn't correctly reproject your layer.</p>
	    <h4>Solution</h4>
	    <p class="solution">This seems to be a problem with particular versions of QGIS on a Mac.  There is a <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/39801">page about the proj.db problem</a> on the web.</p>
	    <p>The possible solutions appear to be:</p>
	    <ul>
		<li>Install a version of QGIS newer than 3.26.  So as of February 2023 try installing version 3.28.</li>
		<li>Or use the Python console to link to proj.db by:</li>
		<ul>
		    <li>Open the Python console by going to <strong>Plugins > Python console.</strong></li>
		    <li>When it opens, type in the two lines of code below:</li>
		</ul>
	    </ul>
	    <pre>
		import os

		os.environ["PROJ_LIB"]="/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/proj"

    <h3>I can't run the Fix Geometries tool successfully.  I'm using a Mac.</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p class="problem">Sometimes you need to run the Fix Geometries tool before being able to use some selection or extraction tools, such as Intersect, Select by Location or Extract by Location.  Unfortunately, on a Mac, this is causing an error and not running.</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p class="solution">Unfortunately this seems to be a problem with Mac not having an updated QGIS package.  There doesn't seem to be a solution at the moment (March 2023), but we'll keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/50888">Github page about the error</a>.</p>
	<p>Until a solution becomes available, all I can suggest is that you try the selection/intersection/extraction tool without using fix geometries.  Sometimes this will work.  If you get an error telling you that you need to fix geometries, then I'm afraid the only solution I can suggest for now is to log on to a Windows computer in a cluster to run this part of the processing.</p>

    <h3>My panels have disappeared in QGIS</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p class="problem">You've been using QGIS, and have managed to close one of the panels, such as the Browser or Layers panel.  How do you get these back again?</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p class="solution">It's very easy to close panels by mistake, and once you know how, it's also very easy to get them back.</p>
    <p>Go to <strong>View > Panels</strong> on the menu bar and put a tick in the box next to the panel(s) that is missing.  It should reappear.</p>
    <p>A similar thing works for toolbars too.  Go to <strong>View > Toolbars</strong> on the menu and click the correct box.</p>

    <h3>I'm importing a spreadsheet with numbers. I'm changing the type to a number, but the fields are still importing as text.</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p class="problem">There seems to be a problem with the Spreadsheet plugin at the moment.  Even if you change columns to a numerical type, such as <strong>Real</strong> before you import them, they are still text once imported. This means you can't then use them in the Field Calculator to create a Total column.</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p class="solution">You can correct this problem by using the <strong>Refactor fields</strong> tool.  Search for <strong>Refactor</strong> in the Processing toolbox.  Once you open that tool you can change field types, so change the fields to <strong>Decimal (double)</strong> or <strong>Integer</strong> (if you don't have decimal places) and you should be able to use the field calculator on them.</p>

    <h3>How do I add a copyright symbol to layout text?</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p class="problem">You're adding a copyright acknowledgement to your map and need to use the copyright symbol - &copy;.</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p class="solution">The solution to this depends on whether you are on a Mac or PC.</p>
    <ul>
	<li>On a <strong>Mac</strong>, use the shortcut '<strong>Option + G</strong>'.</li>
	<li>On a <strong>Windows desktop</strong>, make sure you're in the text properties box, not on the layout itself, then with the number lock on, hold down the <strong>Alt</strong> key, and type <strong>0169</strong> on the number pad.</li>
	<li>If you are on a Windows laptop and don't have a number pad, type <strong>[%char(169)%]</strong> into the text properties box instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I've scanned my geological field slip and it's in pdf format, but now I can't add it to GIS to georeference it.</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p class="problem">As you've discovered QGIS won't allow you to add pdf files to a map.  You need to convert the pdf to png, tiff or jpg formats - any of which will be fine.</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p class="solution">Either rescan the document and select jpg or tiff output, or (and this may be the simpler way to do it!) use one of the many online converters.  <a href="http://smallpdf.com">smallpdf.com</a> is easy to use.  It can convert between pdf and various file types including jpg.</p>
