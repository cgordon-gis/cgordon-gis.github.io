# Introduction

This is some trial content - Good luck!

* [Frequently asked questions][faq] - answers to questions that I'm asked frequently, but that aren't in one of the regular workbooks
* [Useful mapping links][links] - links to freely available maps and data on the web
* [Video clips][videoclips] - links to video clips to support the GIS and graphics workbooks
* [Downloads][downloads] - materials that I have created for use by students and staff at Leeds.  Note that some have restricted access.
